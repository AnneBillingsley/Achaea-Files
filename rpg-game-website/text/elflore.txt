Across the seas, the Elves lived in gentle attunement with the earth. <br> <br>
Theirs was a land blessed by abundant magic, even more so than the mortals, and with it came a long life and a natural affinity for its use. <br> <br>
The flora in their land was sustained by it, the air thick with light, and their god was a cleansing one which purifies it still. <br> <br>
<br>
On the eve of Athena's plan, the Elven god Frey had her premonition, and dove into the land to bring it light. <br> <br>
As magic faded from the eastern shore, she pulsed and grew, swallowing the earth with her form as she spread thin throughout its roots. <br> <br>
In this way, she saved the bounty of the earth. <br> <br>
But Elves were built to thrive alongside her spirit, and found themselves abandoned in this sacrifice. As she fell into that deepest sleep, awaiting the return of magic, the elves found themselves defenceless.<br>  <br>
<br>
When Athena learned of the limitations of her charges, she turned her eyes across the sea, where traders oft disembarked from perilous journeys upon the waves. <br> <br>
She led campaigns to steal away the foreign peoples, with plans of gifting them ascension from their mundane forms. <br> <br>
And in her quest she found the elves. <br> <br>
<br>
While they drew more magic from the earth than a human could handle, the air was thin with magic, and as they breathed they struggled to replace what they once had. <br><br>
Like cannons fed with firewood, they could not fight her legions back.
