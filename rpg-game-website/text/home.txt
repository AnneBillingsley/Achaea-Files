Achaea sits upon a throne of intrigue. The gods they weave and plot a story still. Their arms span leagues, yet man besieged, were carvers of the gods by their own will.

Man long ago once held a crown Achaean. They lived a life of luxury, upon a land abundant. Each race of man adapting to a world that was arcane. While three of these there were of four, who walk the wasteland still, they shaped the truth of their ideals, the gods upon their wills.

And over all who rested in the gentle light of day, Tirnodiost would serve and watch the boundaries of their clay. He split the earth from up and down, the skies above and fertile ground, and light and dark of fragile night, of sunny plains and magic ripe.

And in the west the monsters came, of magic dark on which orcs feast, while in the east a magic bright would fill the earth, with life and light. So in the centre, these did mix, and man grew farther and betwixt. Upon these lands did man adapt, three races each to magic trapped.

The teiflings walk a tightrope that is made of night and day, and their magic seems to balance on the dusk and dawn in play. Far east the humans feed on light and west the monsters fed the night of orcs and goblins travelling and teiflings in their bargaining.

Yet those who cross to either side madness waits, of form or mind, as dark transforms and light may blind, those unaccustomed to its kind. And thus the world remained divined, as divinations of divide, a world of comfort yet confined.

Against the prickling heat of fiction, life began to seem quite stale.

And bathed in glorious benediction, golden gods would turn away

Upon this rock unyielding do I let the record show, the history of man and god, the heralds of the snow.

Of Justice and of scarcity, yet man once lived of these things free. Til in their golden revelry the gods grew trite and cold. Disaster struck the earth, in tales laid buried and untold.
